      "short_bio": "Portgas D. Ace, born as Gol D. Ace and nicknamed \"Fire Fist\" Ace, was the captain of the Spade Pirates before being recruited into the Whitebeard Pirates and becoming its 2nd division commander. The biological son of the late Pirate King Gol D. Roger and Portgas D. Rouge, Ace was put in the care of Monkey D. Garp and Curly Dadan after Roger's death, which is where he became the sworn brother of Monkey D. Luffy and Sabo. Due to Roger's absence from his life, Ace disowned his father and took his mother's surname, ultimately declaring that his captain Whitebeard was his true father. Ace's pursuit of his former subordinate Blackbeard for the murder of their crewmate Thatch led to him being captured after their duel on Banaro Island, and he was turned in to the Marines, who held a public execution for him on Marineford due to his heritage; this triggered the Summit War of Marineford. While freed from bondage, Ace would ultimately lose his life at the hands of Admiral Akainu while protecting Luffy. Ace's death proved the final catalyst following the Straw Hats' defeat at Sabaody that would make Luffy put his crew's journey on hiatus so they could all train for the next two years and return powerful enough to survive the New World on their own, paving the way for the second half of the series. His reincarnated Devil Fruit would eventually be consumed by his sworn brother, Sabo, ensuring that his will would live on. Ace first appeared at the end of the Drum Island Arc, but was only formally introduced in the Arabasta Arc, where he acts as a brief ally of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is a central figure during the entire Summit War Saga. He is also the protagonist of Ace's Great Blackbeard Search cover arc.",

Kid first appeared at the Sabaody Archipelago at the same time Monkey D. Luffy and his crew arrived. Both were described as members of the \"Eleven Supernovas\", pirates who had congregated on the island who all had a bounty of more than 100,000,000. After briefly fighting alongside Luffy while escaping an attack by the Marines, he fled the archipelago and would later spectate the Summit War of Marineford alongside the other Supernovas. During Luffy's two years of training, Kid challenged one of the Four Emperors, Shanks, but lost one of his arms to Benn Beckman in the process. He attempted to form an alliance with the On Air Pirates and Hawkins Pirates to challenge the Red Hair Pirates once more, but the alliance fell apart after an attack from another Emperor, Kaidou, which led to his imprisonment at Wano Country where he would eventually reunite with Luffy. Though nominally acting in self-interest towards vengeance and glory, Kid's assistance towards the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance was instrumental in defeating Kaidou, Big Mom and the Beasts Pirates. After leaving Wano, Kid and his crew arrived at Elbaph and decided to challenge Shanks once more. However, the entire crew and their ship were decimated by Shanks and his allies, Dorry and Brogy. Kid was originally introduced with a bounty of 315,000,000, largely due to a high number of civilian casualties caused by him and his crew, thus exceeding Luffy's when they first arrived at the Sabaody Archipelago. Sometime during the timeskip, his bounty was raised from 315,000,000 to 470,000,000. Kid's bounty was eventually raised to 3,000,000,000 for his role in defeating Big Mom of the Four Emperors alongside Trafalgar Law during the Raid on Onigashima. Due to his actions, Kid can be considered a minor ally during the Sabaody Archipelago Arc as well as a major ally during the Wano Country Arc.",

The two have a son named Capone Pez. While working under the Big Mom Pirates, he held a position of a rook-ranked combatant. Due to his allegiance and actions, he is the secondary antagonist of the Zou Arc. Later, Bege formed a temporary alliance with the Straw Hat Pirates in order to kill Big Mom during the Whole Cake Island Arc. After his plan failed, Bege effectively became an enemy of the Emperor and her crew. Sometime during the timeskip, his bounty increased from 138,000,000 to 300,000,000. After the events of the Whole Cake Island Arc, it has increased to 350,000,000. He is also one of the central characters in \"Gang\" Bege's Oh My Family Cover Page Serial.",

Originally designed by Kaya's servant Merry, it was gifted to the Straw Hats for defending Syrup Village against the Black Cat Pirates. Over time, it came to be loved by the crew as a home and as a friend, so much so that she eventually developed a life of her own and became a genuine crew member. Unfortunately, the Going Merry took an inordinate amount of damage during her \"lifetime\", being blown up, impaled, sliced up multiple times, and partially eaten by Wapol. Eventually, the Merry could no longer continue and after helping the Straw Hats escape Enies Lobby, it received a Viking funeral. After destruction, the Merry was succeeded by the Thousand Sunny, a ship specially built by Franky (and the Galley-La Company) to maintain the \"soul\" of its predecessor.",

He was born 56 years before the present day, but traveled 20 years forward in time when he was 36 years old. Due to Wano Country having been taken over by Kurozumi Orochi, an ally of Kaidou of the Four Emperors, Kin'emon set out on a seafaring quest to recruit warriors for his cause, bringing alongside him his master, Kouzuki Momonosuke, as well as two of his comrades. After a series of misadventures, Kin'emon ended up on the island of Punk Hazard, where he met and joined forces with the Straw Hat Pirates, posing as Momonosuke's father during the journey to Zou. He is one of the central allies of the Straw Hats during the Dressrosa, Whole Cake Island and Wano Country Sagas.",

This duel on Little Garden lasted for a century before being interrupted by the arrival of the Straw Hat Pirates and the machinations of Baroque Works. After finally settling their duel the two giant captains returned to Elbaph and their crew, and later became involved in the Egghead Incident to rescue the Straw Hat Pirates and bring them to safety to Elbaph. A century ago his bounty was 100,000,000, but due to years of inflation and a return to active piracy his bounty was updated to 1,800,000,000. He is a major ally of the Straw Hat Pirates during the Little Garden, Egghead, and Elbaph Arcs. However, after being transformed into a demon by Imu, he became a minor antagonist during the Elbaph Arc.",

She is the seventh member of the crew and the sixth to join, doing so at the end of the Arabasta Arc. She temporarily left the crew during the Water 7 Arc but rejoined during the Enies Lobby Arc. Born into a family of archaeologists, Robin is the daughter of Nico Olvia. Robin ate the Hana Hana no Mi at a young age, giving her the power to reproduce her body parts (or her entire body) on any surface at will. As the sole survivor of the destroyed West Blue island Ohara, she is currently one of only two people in the world known to have the ability to read and decipher Poneglyphs, a skill which is considered forbidden and threatening to the World Government. She acted as the vice president of Baroque Works as \"Miss All Sunday\", serving and partnering herself directly with the organization's president; the ex-Warlord: Crocodile, who operated under the codename \"Mr. 0\". She was the secondary antagonist of the Arabasta Arc and Saga, before joining the Straw Hats. Her dream is to find the Rio Poneglyph which tells the true history of the world, specifically the Void Century. She gained a bounty of 79,000,000 at the age of 8 due to her ability to read poneglyphs after the destruction of Ohara. It later increased to 80,000,000 after the Straw Hats invaded Enies Lobby to rescue her and escape. After the Dressrosa Arc, it was increased to 130,000,000. Following the Raid on Onigashima, her bounty was increased to 930,000,000.",

As a pirate, Kuma sailed the seas as a single-person pirate crew. He is also the adoptive father of Jewelry Bonney, daughter of his late friend and fellow revolutionary Ginny. Kuma is a member of the near-extinct special race known as the Buccaneers, inherited from his late father Clapp. Because of the lies told to the public by the World Government, Kuma became feared as an extremely vicious pirate, earning himself the title \"Tyrant\". In exchange for curing Bonney of the deadly Sapphire Scales disease, Kuma became a special type of cyborg known as a \"Pacifista\", developed by the world renowned scientist Vegapunk. Once Vegapunk finished his modifications on Kuma, the Warlord was converted into the first complete Pacifista cyborg, with the serial PX-0, and mentally died in the process. Vegapunk also cloned Kuma as S-Bear, one of the Seraphim that were designed to replace the Warlords. Kuma has been enslaved by the World Nobles twice in his lifetime: The first time was in his infancy until he escaped during the God Valley Incident and the second time in adulthood as punishment for the two years he spent protecting the Thousand Sunny, which lasted until his fellow revolutionaries freed him during the most recent Levely. While Kuma was presented as a major antagonist during the Thriller Bark and Sabaody Archipelago Arc, he was secretly an ally. His action of separating the Straw Hat Pirates was ultimately done in their best interest, as it saved them from Admiral Kizaru and helped the crew's captain Monkey D. Luffy realize that his crew was too weak to survive in the New World and needed to train first; thus, Kuma played a key role in the subsequent timeskip. In his mindless state, Kuma is a major antagonist in the Marineford Arc where he took part in the Summit War of Marineford and sided with the Marines, along with most of the other Warlords, but he later becomes a major ally during the Egghead Arc and an important figure behind its ongoings.",

      "short_bio": "Charlotte Linlin, better known as \"Big Mom\", is the captain of the Big Mom Pirates and was formerly one of the Four Emperors ruling over the New World, as the only female member of the group. She is the queen of the archipelago nation Totto Land, a place she seeks to form into a utopia where all the world's races can live together in peace without discrimination or segregation. She is also the matriarch of the Charlotte Family, whose children make up the ministers of her nation and the core infrastructure of her crew. Big Mom wields the Soru Soru no Mi, which allows her to steal the souls of others and implant them in inanimate objects, resulting in the unique race of creatures known as homies, who happily serve her. Big Mom possesses three special homies: the bicorne Napoleon, the sun Prometheus, and the thunder cloud Hera. Hera's position was formerly owned by another thunder cloud, Zeus, but Big Mom grew tired of Zeus' continued failures and created Hera to replace him. In her childhood, Linlin was raised on Elbaph in the Sheep's House under Carmel after being abandoned by her family. After accidentally slaying Jorul, a hero of Elbaph, during one of her hunger pangs, Linlin was relocated to another island. During Linlin's birthday party, as she gorged on sweets, Carmel and her fellow orphans mysteriously disappeared and Linlin inherited Carmel's Devil Fruit. Now alone, she was discovered by Streusen, and the pair co-founded a pirate crew. As a young adult, Big Mom joined the legendary Rocks Pirates, where she formed a bond with apprentice Kaidou. Some time after the God Valley Incident where the Rocks Pirates fell, she formed her own crew once again, the Big Mom Pirates. Big Mom developed an enmity with Monkey D. Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates, who challenged her ownership of Fish-Man Island and then invaded Whole Cake Island, thwarting her plans to steal technology from the advanced Germa Kingdom during an arranged wedding between Sanji and her daughter, Charlotte Pudding. This grudge brought her to Wano Country in pursuit of Luffy, where she formed an alliance with Kaidou and the Beasts Pirates with the intention of conquering the world and claiming the One Piece. However, this never came to fruition as their alliance would go on to be defeated by the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance that same night. Following her defeat to Eustass Kid and Trafalgar Law, the World Economy News Paper released a new listing of the Four Emperors, with Big Mom no longer being included among them anymore. As a young child at the beginning of her piracy career, Big Mom was assigned a 50,000,000 bounty which was quickly escalated to 500,000,000. By the time of the Raid on Onigashima, at the peak of her piracy career, she held a bounty of 4,388,000,000 which was the second-highest bounty of any living pirate. Big Mom was the last of the Four Emperors to be named; her epithet was first revealed after the Summit War of Marineford by Eustass Kid and her real name was revealed by Pappag on Fish-Man Island. Since the timeskip, she is a minor antagonist during the Fish-Man Island Arc, the main antagonist of the Whole Cake Island Arc and the Whole Cake Island Saga as a whole, and the secondary antagonist of the second half of the Wano Country Arc and Wano Country Saga as a whole.",

Initially an undistinguished (albeit feared) presence in the East Blue, it began pursuing a vendetta after being defeated by the Straw Hat Pirates, and followed them into the Grand Line. Since then, several unlikely circumstances and Buggy's constantly-revolving fortunes have repeatedly overhauled it: first into an alliance with the Alvida Pirates, then into the Seven Warlords-affiliated Buggy's Delivery, and finally into the Four Emperors-affiliated Cross Guild. Due to their actions and role, they serve as the main antagonists of the Orange Town Arc, the protagonists of the Buggy's Crew Adventure Chronicles mini-arc, co-antagonists (alongside Smoker and his Marine unit) in the Loguetown Arc, and side-characters in the Jaya Arc. After the timeskip, they have made tertiary appearances throughout the Dressrosa Arc, the Zou Arc, and the Wano Country Arc.",

For 5 years of his life, Oden set out to sea and became a pirate, serving as the 2nd division commander of the Whitebeard Pirates and later becoming a member of the Roger Pirates. After finding Joy Boy's treasure on Laugh Tale, Oden journeyed home and made it his goal to open Wano's borders to the world by finally taking his father's place as shogun. However, he met opposition from his usurper Kurozumi Orochi and the pirate Kaidou, who executed him 20 years before the present, in an event known as the Legendary Hour. Oden's name was first mentioned during the Zou Arc. He is the posthumous overarching protagonist of the Wano Country Arc, being the protagonist of a series of events taking place in and outside Wano in the past.",

After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually entered the care of Zeff as the sous chef of the Baratie, where he would remain until he met Luffy, who convinced him to join his crew. His dream is to find the rumored chef's paradise, the All Blue, which is where the East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South Blue meet, along with their wildlife. He is one of the top three fighters of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Zoro, who is referred to as the \"Monster Trio\". He first gained a bounty of 77,000,000 for his role in the raid on Enies Lobby. It increased to 177,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc, but the condition of his bounty was changed to Only Alive due to his biological father's interference. After he escaped from Big Mom's territory, his bounty condition was reverted to Dead or Alive (with the Vinsmoke name despite his renouncing it), and its value increased to 330,000,000.

Since then, he has become a founding executive of the Cross Guild, alongside fellow ex-Warlord Crocodile. Mihawk once led a renowned rivalry with Shanks, currently one of the Four Emperors. In turn, he is viewed as the ultimate opponent by Roronoa Zoro, who pursues his own dream of becoming the world's strongest swordsman. Though Mihawk easily won their first encounter, he grew to respect Zoro, and agreed to mentor him in further swordsmanship during the timeskip. Like the other ex-Warlords, Mihawk has been cloned by Dr. Vegapunk to create one of the Seraphim, S-Hawk, as part of a project to replace the Warlord system. Due to his actions and role, Mihawk can be considered a supporting antagonist in the Baratie Arc and one of the major antagonists in the Marineford Arc, where he took part in the Summit War of Marineford on the side of the Marines, along with most of the other Warlords of the Sea.",

Franky was born in the South Blue to Scien, an infamous scientist and pirate who would later be known as Queen of the Beasts Pirates. After his parents abandoned him as a 10-year-old, he eventually made his way to Water 7. Born \"Cutty Flam\", he chose to go by his nickname of \"Franky\" until he eventually permanently discarded his true name per the request of Iceburg to hide his identity. He worked as a shipwright of Tom's Workers until, during a failed attempt to save his mentor Tom from the World Government, his body was heavily damaged, requiring him to augment himself into a cyborg. Upon returning to Water 7, he became the leader of the Franky Family, a group of ship dismantlers and bounty hunters. Franky and his followers were introduced as the secondary antagonists of the Water 7 Arc, until circumstances forced them to become allies at the end of the same arc and the Enies Lobby Arc. Franky's dream is to create a ship and circumnavigate the world with it, and he built the Thousand Sunny and joined the Straw Hat Pirates to fulfill his dream. He gained a bounty of 44,000,000 for his involvement at the Enies Lobby Incident. It later increased to 94,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to 394,000,000.",

Born in God Valley to the Figarland Family of the World Nobles, Shanks is the son of Figarland Garling and the younger twin brother of Shamrock. However, as an infant during the God Valley Incident, Shanks was bequeathed to Monkey D. Dragon by his mother. He ended up in a treasure chest which was stolen by the Roger Pirates, resulting in him being adopted and raised onboard the Oro Jackson. He served on Gol D. Roger's crew as an apprentice alongside Buggy. After Roger's death, Shanks began to assemble his own crew, only to then return to Mary Geoise to reunite with his family and join the Knights of God, becoming Saint Shanks. However, Shanks ultimately abdicated his noble status after working against Mary Geoise; he then rapidly attained infamy as a pirate before being named as one of the Emperors six years ago. Shanks is a major figure in Monkey D. Luffy's life, having saved his life as a child twelve years ago and inspiring Luffy to set his own path as a pirate to surpass him someday. He gave Luffy the straw hat that Roger once wore, as a symbol of their promise to meet again once Luffy had surpassed him, and also accidentally enabled Luffy to eat the Gomu Gomu no Mi. Two years ago, Shanks was pivotal in bringing the Summit War of Marineford to a close. Following the downfall of his rival Emperors in Wano Country, Shanks has set his sights on claiming the One Piece. Shanks has been an important background character throughout the series, usually being shown acknowledging Luffy's ever-growing reputation as a pirate. He serves as a minor ally to Luffy during both the Marineford and Wano Country Arcs. He and his crew also have a sizable role in One Piece Film: Red, which centers on Uta, Shanks' adopted daughter."

He is also the sworn brother of the notorious pirates Monkey D. Luffy and the late Portgas D. Ace. Raised in nobility by his parents Outlook III and Didit in the Goa Kingdom, Sabo ran away and met Ace and Luffy while living as a vagabond in Gray Terminal. He tried to set sail just a few months afterward to get away from his family, but had his ship destroyed by the World Noble Saint Jalmack. He was saved by Dragon but lost his memory in the process, and so devoted his life to the service of the Revolutionary Army. However, his memories would return 10 years later after hearing about Ace's death. Two years after regaining his memories, Sabo would reunite with Luffy and also carry Ace's legacy by consuming his Devil Fruit, the Mera Mera no Mi. After storming the Holy Land during the most recent Levely with several other commanders of the Revolutionary Army, Sabo was framed for the assassination of Nefertari Cobra, increasing his notoriety across the world and sparking several rebellions. He acts as an ally of Luffy during the Dressrosa Arc, as well as the movies One Piece Film: Gold and One Piece: Stampede.",

He was a member of the Sun Pirates, eventually becoming its second captain after the death of their original captain, Tiger. He eventually became one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, though he resigned during the Summit War of Marineford.

Luffy, and two years later allied with him and his crew to prevent the New Fish-Man Pirates' coup d'état against the Ryugu Kingdom's Neptune Royal Family. Luffy thereafter invited him to join the Straw Hat Pirates, but Jinbe held it off until severing ties with Big Mom during the Whole Cake Island Arc.

However, due to the amount of time it took for his soul to find his body, it was reduced to a skeleton, keeping only his afro intact. Brook drifted alone in the Florian Triangle for 50 years, eventually meeting Luffy and serving as the Straw Hats' ally during the Thriller Bark Arc before officially joining the crew. His dream is to reunite with his old friend, Laboon, at Reverse Mountain, where he resides with Crocus. He first gained a bounty of 33,000,000 during his time as a member of the Rumbar Pirates. It later increased to 83,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to 383,000,000.",

Widely known as the \"Strongest Man in the World\", he was considered the \"Man Closest to One Piece\" after Gol D. Roger's death. Growing up as an orphan on the island of Sphinx, Newgate went on to become a pirate, eventually joining the legendary Rocks Pirates. Sometime after the Rocks Pirates' disbanding, he went on to form his own crew, taking on the nickname \"Whitebeard\" and eventually becoming one of the Four Emperors that rule over the New World. He shared a friendly rivalry with Roger, to whom he lent one of his crewmates, Kouzuki Oden, so that Oden could help Roger discover the final island of the Grand Line, a goal that Whitebeard had no interest in. Following Roger's death, Whitebeard became recognized as the strongest man in the world, a fact complimented by having the highest active bounty whilst alive, and the second highest bounty of any pirate in history. Later in life, Whitebeard unknowingly took Roger's son, Portgas D. Ace, under his wing. After Ace was arrested by the Marines during a doomed attempt to hunt down Whitebeard's traitorous crew member Marshall D. Teach, Ace was to be executed by the Marines as a display to end the Great Pirate Era. Whitebeard, his crew and his allies all laid siege to Marineford to rescue Ace, resulting in the Summit War of Marineford which concluded with the deaths of both Ace and Whitebeard at the hands of Akainu and Teach, respectively. In his final moments, Whitebeard announced to the world that the One Piece did in fact exist, inspiring a new wave of pirates and effectively beginning the New Age. Whitebeard was an ally of Monkey D. Luffy and a central figure overall during the Marineford Arc.",

Caesar Clown, who was referred to as \"Master\" by his subordinates, is a scientist, the leading expert on chemical weapons of mass destruction, and one of the co-founders of NEO MADS. Caesar is a former colleague of Vegapunk, having worked with him both in MADS and later the World Government research facility on Punk Hazard, an island that Caesar went on to devastate with a toxic gas explosion, earning him a bounty of 300,000,000. Years later, Caesar returned to the island in secret to continue his illegal experiments until his defeat at the hands of the Straw Hat Pirates and Trafalgar Law. One of his projects was the production of SAD, a chemical that he supplied to the Warlord Donquixote Doflamingo to be used in the manufacturing of SMILEs, artificial Devil Fruits which were sold to the Emperor Kaidou to help create an army of Zoans. Although Caesar was briefly protected from the law by Doflamingo, this protection was lost when Doflamingo was defeated and arrested. After a period as a hostage of the Straw Hat-Heart Pirate Alliance, he fell into the custody of Big Mom on Whole Cake Island. There, Caesar was forced to continue his development of gigantification drugs until he was liberated by the Fire Tank Pirates and forced to take part in an assassination attempt against Big Mom. Following the plan's failure, Caesar finally parted ways with his former captors, escaping with the Vinsmoke Family to the Germa Kingdom, where he would establish NEO MADS with fellow ex-MADS member Vinsmoke Judge. Caesar is the main antagonist of the Punk Hazard Arc and a reluctant ally of the Straw Hat Pirates during the Dressrosa Arc, Zou Arc, and Whole Cake Island Arc.

He is also the father of Yamato. Once a child soldier in the service of the Vodka Kingdom, Kaidou joined the legendary Rocks Pirates as an apprentice in his teenage years. A few years after the God Valley Incident, he formed his own pirate crew and built it up into a powerful military force determined to challenge the World Government and change the world. Kaidou then joined forces with Wano Country's shogun Kurozumi Orochi and occupied Onigashima as his base for nearly three decades. In the present day, Kaidou formed an unprecedented pirate alliance with fellow Emperor and former crewmate Big Mom for the purpose of taking over the world. He then betrayed Orochi to enact his New Onigashima Project for Wano. The plan never came to fruition, however, as Onigashima was raided by the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance on that very same night and Kaidou was ultimately bested by Monkey D. Luffy. Following this defeat, Kaidou lost his position among the Four Emperors. Kaidou was first referred to by Monkey D. Garp in the Post-Enies Lobby Arc when he revealed the existence of the Four Emperors, and was then first directly mentioned by Gecko Moria in the Thriller Bark Arc. Before he debuted in person, his voice was heard in a flashback that Kouzuki Momonosuke had when first disembarking on Dressrosa. Due to his actions, he can be considered the overarching antagonist of the Dressrosa Saga, the main antagonist of the Wano Country Arc and Saga, and a major antagonist of the second half of the series.",

Dragon, the paternal grandfather of Monkey D. Luffy, and the adoptive grandfather of Portgas D. Ace. He was responsible for overseeing Ace's birth and raising a young Luffy, before entrusting them both to the Dadan Family. A contemporary of Gol D. Roger in his prime, Garp came to be known as the only Marine that could seriously challenge the Pirate King, with feats to match; his participation in the God Valley Incident, that led to the defeat and disbanding of the infamous Rocks Pirates, won him the title \"Hero of the Marines\". His prestigious career has not only afforded him multiple promotion offers to Admiral, but the freedom to refuse (due to his deep hatred and contempt for World Nobles) without consequence. At the same time, he has mentored many younger Marines into prominence, including once-Admiral Kuzan and SWORD members Koby and Helmeppo. After Ace's death at the Summit War of Marineford, Garp became an instructor to focus on training new recruits. While the public believes him to be retired, he still retains the rank of Vice Admiral. During his mission to rescue Koby from the Blackbeard Pirates, Garp was badly injured and imprisoned on Hachinosu, being officially declared \"missing in action\" by the Marines. Garp was first introduced during the Diary of Koby-Meppo cover arc, where he first took charge of training Koby and Helmeppo. Due to his actions, he is the main antagonist of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc and a supporting antagonist in the Marineford Arc.",

Once freed, Arlong set his sights on conquering the East Blue, settling himself on the Conomi Islands alongside his crew and racketeering the local population.

Arlong then had Nami become his subordinate, taking advantage of her cartography skills to one day conquer all of the Blue Sea.

      "short_bio": "Monkey D. Luffy, commonly known as \"Straw Hat Luffy\" or simply \"Straw Hat\", is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates. He pursues the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger in order to become the new Pirate King and reach a further, untold dream (currently known to only his crew, family and closest friends). He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world. Born on Dawn Island, Luffy is the son of Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon and grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp and as such is a member of the Clan of D. Most of his childhood was shaped by Garp and Curly Dadan, under whose care he befriended and swore brotherhood to the late Portgas D. Ace and Sabo. However, he draws his greatest inspiration from the pirate Shanks, who (unwittingly) enabled him to eat the Devil Fruit that turned his body into rubber, sacrificed an arm to save his life, and gifted his signature straw hat as a symbol of their vow to reunite someday, after Luffy became a great pirate. As a pirate, Luffy has actively opposed countless regional, national, and global powers, beginning with several established East Blue pirates and extending to the Marines, the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Cipher Pol, the World Nobles and Five Elders, and even the Four Emperors of the New World. Despite his young age and relatively short career, he has triumphed over a majority of these, successfully invading and indirectly causing the annihilation of Enies Lobby, escaping the impregnable Impel Down, enabling several key developments in the Summit War of Marineford, and defeating three Warlords and an Emperor in direct combat. At the same time, he carries a great penchant for attracting friends and allies; in addition to personally engaging every member of his crew, he has earned regard and gratitude among many nations, fellow pirates, the Revolutionary Army, and even several Marines. Luffy has gained worldwide infamy through his accomplishments, heritage, and general recklessness, drawing many large bounties as well as the focused hostility of the World Government, Marine Headquarters, and Fleet Admiral Sakazuki in particular. Currently, he is recognized as a central member of the Worst Generation, the unwilling leader of the seven-crew Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and—in wake of defeating Kaidou during the Raid on Onigashima—one of the Four Emperors, with a bounty of 3,000,000,000. Since the awakening of the Gomu Gomu no Mi for the first time in centuries, Luffy has also been heralded as the second coming of Joy Boy, as well as the current incarnation of the Sun God, Nika.

She and the bar she ran at Hachinosu became famous in the world of pirates; while she was beloved by both the Rocks Pirates and Roger Pirates, she only had eyes for Silvers Rayleigh, the Roger Pirates' First Mate. 38 years ago, Shakky was kidnapped and made the ultimate prize for the winner of the Native Hunting Competition on God Valley, which served as one of the major triggers of the God Valley Incident. She was rescued by Rayleigh, which ultimately solidified their romantic relationship. She is a minor ally of the Straw Hat Pirates during the Sabaody Archipelago Arc.",

Escaping sometime after Oden's execution 20 years ago, Sukiyaki went into hiding and lived as a hermit under the name Tenguyama Hitetsu; he resided in Amigasa Village in Kuri and raised the young girl Kurozumi Tama as his ward. After Orochi was overthrown and his grandson Momonosuke took power, Sukiyaki revealed his identity to his family and their retainers, but chose to remain hidden from the general public due to his shame over what he allowed to happen to Wano.",

However, within the next two years, he managed to be reinstated into Cipher Pol as part of CP0, this time as Spandam's superior. Lucci is the secondary antagonist of the Water 7 Saga, appearing as the main antagonist of the Water 7 Arc and the secondary antagonist of the Enies Lobby Arc.

During the Straw Hat Pirates' escape from Totto Land, Zeus was captured by the Straw Hats and forced to become Nami's servant.

However, Big Mom later abandoned Zeus for good after he had struggled during the battle at Onigashima, replacing him with another homie named Hera. She attempted to remove her soul fragment from him, but he survived the ordeal by permanently fusing with Nami's Clima-Tact as a vessel. Zeus then joined Nami for good, this time as her partner.",

Due to their actions and role, they serve as the main antagonists of the Orange Town Arc, the protagonists of the Buggy's Crew Adventure Chronicles mini-arc, co-antagonists (alongside Smoker and his Marine unit) in the Loguetown Arc, and side-characters in the Jaya Arc.

After his family lost their status as Celestial Dragons and became pariahs, Rosinante was discovered by Sengoku and enlisted into the Marines, eventually reaching the rank of Commander. Upon reuniting with Doflamingo, he feigned muteness and operated as an Elite Officer of the Donquixote Pirates, serving Doflamingo under the codename Corazon while remaining an undercover Marine. Rosinante abandoned his post in an attempt to cure Trafalgar D. Water Law of his Amber Lead Syndrome. He eventually obtained the Ope Ope no Mi, forcing Law to eat it and thus giving him the means to save himself from the disease. However, his cover was blown by the former Corazon, Vergo, and he was subsequently executed by Doflamingo. Rosinante's kindness and sacrifice would serve as driving motivators for Law to one day avenge him by defeating Doflamingo.",

Kanjuro became Kouzuki Oden's retainer and one of the Nine Red Scabbards while secretly aiding Orochi in his rise to power and efforts to eliminate the Kouzuki bloodline, by feeding him information. He would continue to do so until he revealed himself as Orochi's spy just before the Raid on Onigashima, leading to his former comrades engaging in battle with him until he was lethally wounded by Kin'emon during a final skirmish, dubbing it his final act. He was born 54 years before the present day, but traveled 20 years forward in time when he was 34 years old. He acted as an ally to the Straw Hat Pirates in his undercover role during the Dressrosa Arc and Zou Arc, but was revealed to be a major antagonist of the Wano Country Arc during its third act.",

He is the son of the infamous pirate Rocks D. Xebec and Eris, making him a member of the nearly extinct Davy Family, thus a descendant of the legendary pirate Davy D. Jones which is only known to a small number of individuals, including his own crew and the Five Elders. He is also the only known person in history to wield the powers of two Devil Fruits. Teach started out his pirate career as an apprentice of the Whitebeard Pirates, then later became a member of the crew's 2nd Division. However, he murdered Thatch, the 4th Division Commander, in order to steal the Yami Yami no Mi, a rare darkness-based Logia Devil Fruit with the power to nullify the Devil Fruit abilities of others. He then fled from Whitebeard's crew and, after defeating the infamous 2nd Division Commander Portgas D. Ace and handing him over to the Marines, was awarded a position among the Seven Warlords of the Sea. He only held the position briefly, though, using it to infiltrate the great underwater prison Impel Down and escaping with multiple infamous Level 6 prisoners recruited into his crew. Upon arriving at the Summit War of Marineford, he resigned from his position and murdered Whitebeard, mysteriously stealing his quake-generating power. This, along with his victory in the Payback War and conquest of the majority of Whitebeard's territories during the timeskip, resulted in his acknowledgement as one of the Four Emperors, as well as him being considered a part of the \"Worst Generation\" along with the eleven Supernovas. After the Rocky Port Incident, he turned the island of Hachinosu into his base of operations with the ambition of having it officially accepted into the World Government as the Blackbeard Kingdom. Teach initially had no bounty; however, after resigning from the Seven Warlords, recruiting several dangerous criminals to his crew from Impel Down, and becoming one of the Four Emperors, he received a bounty of 2,247,600,000. Following the downfalls of Kaidou and Big Mom during the Wano Country Arc, his bounty was increased to 3,996,000,000 for unknown reasons. Due to his actions throughout the series, namely his key role in the deaths of Portgas D. Ace and Whitebeard, Teach consistently serves as one of the primary antagonists of the entire series. During the series' first half, he is an unseen minor antagonist in the Drum Island Arc, a minor antagonist in the Jaya Arc, the secondary antagonist of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, and the overarching antagonist of the Summit War Saga. During the series' second half, he is a minor antagonist in the Dressrosa Arc and Wano Country Arc, a supporting antagonist in the Egghead Arc, and one of the overarching main antagonists in the Final Saga.",

Initially a Roger Pirates apprentice alongside Shanks, Buggy succeeded his disbanded mentors as a career pirate in the East Blue, in time becoming captain of the Buggy Pirates. One of the earliest enemies defeated by Monkey D. Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates, revenge drove him to an alliance with \"Iron Mace\" Alvida and pursuit into the Grand Line. Since then, his fortunes have constantly, dramatically revolved: from imprisonment in Impel Down to entanglement in its first mass-breakout and the subsequent Summit War of Marineford, his escalating infamy won him entry to the Seven Warlords of the Sea, allowing him to launch the pirate mercenary organization Buggy's Delivery. After the Warlords were outlawed, Buggy found himself \"leading\" the Cross Guild, a successor group actually controlled by fellow ex-Warlords Crocodile and Dracule Mihawk; with his inflated reputation, he was grudgingly retained as figurehead leader, and gained recognition as one of the new Emperors. Emboldened, Buggy has declared his intent to become the Pirate King, putting Cross Guild in pursuit of One Piece. He is the main antagonist of the Orange Town Arc and a secondary antagonist in the Loguetown Arc, as well as the central protagonist of the Buggy's Crew Adventure Chronicles cover arc (the manga's first). Since then, he has become one of the series' most-recurring characters, serving as a supporting character through the Summit War Saga in addition to tertiary appearances in the Jaya Arc, Zou Arc, Wano Country Arc, and Egghead Arc. He is also the main antagonist in most episodes of \"Boss Luffy Historical Special\". He also serves as a reluctant ally to Luffy in the <s>3D</s>2Y special episode, and the movie One Piece: Stampede.",

He hailed from the technologically advanced Karakuri Island and resided on Egghead, where his laboratory is located. Before being employed under the World Government, Vegapunk had been the director of an outlaw scientific research team known as MADS. The team was eventually arrested, and Vegapunk was later integrated into the Marines as its head scientist after MADS' dissolution. During his tenure at Egghead, he created six copies, or \"satellites\", of himself, each embodying an aspect of his personality. However, once York revealed to the World Government that Vegapunk was researching the Void Century, they dispatched CP0 and conspired with her to eliminate him, which resulted in the monumental Egghead Incident. Vegapunk was killed by his old friend, Admiral Kizaru, during the ensuing Buster Call on Egghead. Foreseeing his assassination, however, Vegapunk left behind an important message to be broadcasted around the world regarding a catastrophic global future event. He was survived by all six of his satellites: most ascended with Punk Records into the clouds, York remained with the World Government, and Lilith escaped with the Straw Hat Pirates and is attempting to resurrect Vegapunk via cloning. First mentioned during the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Vegapunk was a major background character throughout the series until his proper introduction during the Egghead Arc, becoming a major ally to the Straw Hat Pirates alongside his satellites and playing a central role during its ongoings.",

Originally king of the Grand Line's Drum Island, Wapol fled when the Blackbeard Pirates attacked (spending some time as the \"captain\" of his own, improvised pirate crew) and was permanently deposed by the Straw Hat Pirates soon after. However, his chance creation of a unique \"miracle\" alloy allowed him to rebuild as a toy manufacturer, winning wealth and power anew and eventually securing his current kingdom with the world-famous Kinderella as consort. After accidentally witnessing the Five Elders and Imu assassinating King Nefertari Cobra at the latest Levely, he went into hiding aboard \"Big News\" Morgan's airship alongside Nefertari Vivi. He is the main antagonist of the Drum Island Arc (and by extension the ninth movie). He is also the protagonist of the Wapol's Omnivorous Hurrah cover arc.",

A proponent of \"Humane Justice\", Fujitora notably spearheaded a campaign for the abolishment of the \"Seven Warlords of the Sea\" system, which came to pass during the most recent Levely. Fujitora was first mentioned by Sakazuki when the latter was discussing plans to deal with Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar Law on Dressrosa.

During the first half of the series, he was one of the three Admirals, and was the last one out of the three to debut. Upon becoming the Fleet Admiral, one of Sakazuki's first decisions was to relocate Marine Headquarters into the New World in preparation for the New Pirate Age. In the manga, Akainu was first mentioned by Nico Robin during the initial encounter with Aokiji. In the anime, he was mentioned earlier by Vice Admiral Jonathan during the anime-only G-8 Arc, which aired after Akainu had been revealed in the manga. Sakazuki is perhaps the strictest follower of Absolute Justice in the entire series, to the point where his extremism prompted his fellow Admiral Aokiji to oppose his promotion to Fleet Admiral and resign from the Marines after this effort failed. Due of his actions and role, Sakazuki is the main antagonist of the Marineford Arc and a major antagonist in the Final Saga and the second half of the series.",

Thanks to experiments conducted by Jaygarcia Saturn of the Five Elders, Bonney acquired the powers of the Toshi Toshi no Mi, which allows her to manipulate the age of herself and others at will. She also inherited the Sapphire Scales disease from her mother, forcing her to live inside Kuma's church through her early childhood. After Kuma sacrificed his body and free will to the World Government in exchange for Dr. Vegapunk curing Bonney, she ventured forth from her home to become a pirate in search of her father, using her ability to appear as a young woman in her twenties, despite still being a little girl, having been ten years old during her debut and now being twelve after the timeskip.. Bonney eventually succeeded in reuniting with her father after he saved her life during the Egghead Incident. Upon reaching the Sabaody Archipelago, Bonney had a bounty of 140,000,000. Two years later, it was raised to 320,000,000. Bonney is a companion and major ally of the Straw Hat Pirates during the Egghead Arc and Elbaph Arc.",

She rules over the Kuja tribe with her two younger sisters, Boa Sandersonia and Boa Marigold. Kidnapped by the World Nobles as a child along with her sisters, she was enslaved and tortured for years; during this time she was force-fed the Mero Mero no Mi, which gives her the ability to turn both living and non-living things into stone. She and her sisters escaped from Mary Geoise during a mass breakout instigated by Fisher Tiger. She was returned to her home with the help of Gloriosa, Silvers Rayleigh and Shakuyaku, where she would eventually become the island's empress, as well as one of the Seven Warlords. Though initially antagonistic towards Monkey D. Luffy, his selfless actions and animosity towards the Celestial Dragons caused her to befriend, and eventually fall in love, with him. She went on to serve as one of Luffy's most stalwart allies, helping him infiltrate Impel Down, siding with him in the Summit War of Marineford, providing him a location to train on for two years, and then helping him reunite with his crew and supporting him from afar. While employed within the Seven Warlords, she turned against the World Government on a number of occasions to support Luffy, though she was able to retain her title by feigning innocence. However, the Warlords were officially abolished after the most recent Levely, causing her to lose her status and became one of the world's most wanted criminals. Vegapunk was able to clone Hancock as one of the Seraphim, S-Snake, to replace the Warlords. She first gained a bounty of 80,000,000 due to her being a captain of the Kuja Pirates before it was frozen after she joined the Seven Warlords. However, after the abolition of the Seven Warlords, Hancock's bounty was reinstated and raised to 1,659,000,000. She initially serves as the main antagonist of the Amazon Lily Arc, before becoming a major ally for the rest of the Summit War Saga, as well as the Return to Sabaody Arc. She also acts as an ally of Luffy during the <s>3D</s>2Y special, the Cidre Guild filler Arc, and the movie One Piece: Stampede.",

During his time as Warlord, Crocodile maintained a public facade of an ally to both the people of Arabasta Kingdom and the Marines, all while running Baroque Works in secret with the express purpose of overthrowing Arabasta via Operation Utopia. When his plot was foiled by the Straw Hat Pirates, he was stripped of his title and imprisoned in the deepest level of the legendary prison Impel Down. His former partner and Vice-President of Baroque Works, Nico Robin, would go on to become a member of the Straw Hat Pirates. Crocodile was freed by Luffy from Impel Down in exchange for aiding in the rescue of his brother and went to Marineford to participate in the Summit War. While initially aiming to kill Whitebeard, his contempt for the Marines led him to ally with Luffy and the Whitebeard Pirates. After the war, he and his subordinate Daz Bonez escaped from Marineford and decided to head out to the New World. After the disbandment of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Crocodile now works as a co-leader of the Cross Guild alongside Dracule Mihawk and under the figurehead leadership of Buggy, who was mistakenly made one of the Four Emperors. Sometime prior to the disbanding of the Warlords, Vegapunk cloned Crocodile as one of the Seraphim to replace the Warlords. He is one of the longest running and most noteworthy primary adversaries of the series, being the first enemy to hand Luffy a complete and utter defeat. He is the main antagonist of the Arabasta Arc and the Arabasta Saga overall, a tentative ally in both the Impel Down and Marineford Arcs, and a supporting antagonist in the Final Saga.",

The pirates promised they would come back for Laboon someday, so the whale still awaits their return to this day. As a former and the only surviving member of the Rumbar Pirates, it is Brook's ultimate goal to reunite with Laboon.

After effectively dominating East Blue piracy, Krieg attempted to conquer the Grand Line, only to have his fleet decimated by Dracule Mihawk of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Fleeing back to the East Blue, he tried to capture the Baratie as his new ship, but met further defeat from Monkey D. Luffy. Taken away from the Baratie by his right-hand man Gin, Krieg continued his pirating career, eventually arriving at the pirate island Hachinosu.

This plan succeeded, with Orochi deposing the Kouzuki Family around three decades before the present day after allying with Kaidou of the Four Emperors. Orochi ruled Wano tyrannically until he was deposed by none other than Kaidou, who betrayed him to seize Wano for himself; Orochi survived Kaidou's attack and tried to kill everyone on Onigashima out of spite but was then killed after two encounters with the Kouzuki Family's Nine Red Scabbards who he knew had been prophesied to overthrow him. Due to his actions and role, he is the secondary antagonist of the first half and a supporting antagonist in the second half of the Wano Country Arc, and one of the major antagonists of the Wano Country Saga overall.",

This duel on Little Garden lasted for a century before being interrupted by the arrival of the Straw Hat Pirates and the machinations of Baroque Works. After finally settling their duel the two giant captains returned to Elbaph and their crew, and later became involved in the Egghead Incident to rescue the Straw Hat Pirates and bring them to safety to Elbaph. A century ago his bounty was 100,000,000, but due to years of inflation and a return to active piracy his bounty was updated to 1,800,000,000. He is a major ally of the Straw Hat Pirates during the Little Garden, Egghead, and Elbaph Arcs. However, after being transformed into a demon by Imu, he became a minor antagonist during the Elbaph Arc.",

Water Law, more commonly known as just Trafalgar Law and by his epithet as the \"Surgeon of Death\", is a pirate from the North Blue and the captain and doctor of the Heart Pirates. He is one of twelve pirates who are referred to as the \"Worst Generation\". He became one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea during the timeskip, but his position was revoked for allying with the Straw Hat Pirates. Like many other pirates, Law has dreams of finding the One Piece, while also desiring to know the purpose of the Will of D. Law is the only known survivor of Flevance, a town whose inhabitants suffered from a condition known as Amber Lead Syndrome. Because the disease was fatal and poorly understood, Flevance was destroyed by neighboring countries out of fear (including Law's parents and younger sister), with a young Law barely escaping alive. He subsequently joined the Donquixote Pirates, where Donquixote Doflamingo intended to make Law one of his executive officers. However, thanks to the efforts of Doflamingo's brother, Rosinante, Law was freed from the Donquixote Pirates' influence and became a pirate set to bring down Doflamingo's empire. As part of his plan, he allied himself with Monkey D. Luffy, and together they not only defeated Doflamingo, but also two of the Four Emperors. During the timeskip, his bounty increased from 200,000,000 to 440,000,000 before it was frozen due to his induction into the Seven Warlords of the Sea. However, after having his title revoked during the events of the Dressrosa Arc, Law's bounty was reinstated and raised to 500,000,000. Eventually, his bounty would be raised to 3,000,000,000 for his role in taking down Big Mom of the Four Emperors alongside Eustass Kid during the Wano Country Arc. Law joins forces with the Straw Hat Pirates for a brief moment during the Sabaody Archipelago Arc and later on saves Luffy's life at the very end of the Marineford Arc. He is one of the central allies of the Straw Hat Pirates during the Dressrosa, Whole Cake Island, and Wano Country Sagas.

Momonosuke was born 28 years ago while his parents were sailing with the Whitebeard Pirates. Though rightfully the heir to the shogunate after Oden, the Kouzuki Family was deposed by the Kurozumi Family during Oden's travels, and attempts were made on Momonosuke's life by Kurozumi Orochi's administration. Oden was executed when Momonosuke was 8, and Orochi and Kaidou began waging open warfare to eliminate the Kouzuki bloodline. To keep Momonosuke safe, Toki sent him 20 years forward in time with several of his retainers. Upon reappearing, Momonosuke and his men went out to sea to recruit allies for a planned battle against Orochi and Kaidou. To conceal his identity, Momonosuke pretended to be the son of his retainer Kin'emon. Throughout their voyage, return to Wano, and climactic battle with Kaidou's forces, Momonosuke steadily grew to accept and assume his role as the leader of the Kouzuki Family and their allies. To be of better use during the conflict, Momonosuke had his retainer Shinobu use her Juku Juku ability to age his body 20 years, though he remains a child mentally. The Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance emerged victorious from this war, and Momonosuke attained his rightful position of shogun to unanimous support from the Wano citizens; he would go on to be renowned as one of Wano's greatest leaders. He was first mentioned when Kin'emon told Sanji that he came to Punk Hazard to rescue his \"son\". His given name was revealed when the samurai was asking if the captive children in the Biscuits Room had seen him, and his clan name was revealed when Kin'emon spoke of his true heritage. He is a major ally of the Straw Hat Pirates during the entirety of the Dressrosa and Wano Country Sagas.",

He is also a former World Noble, descended from the Donquixote Family. He is the first son of the late Donquixote Homing and the older brother of the late Rosinante, both of whom he killed out of feeling betrayed by them. Doflamingo became the King of Dressrosa after taking the throne from Riku Doldo III eight years before the start of the series. He ruled the country tyrannically until he was stripped of his positions as a Warlord of the Sea and king after he was defeated by Monkey D. Luffy near the end of the Dressrosa Arc. After Doflamingo was arrested by Admiral Fujitora along with most of his crew, he was locked up at Impel Down and placed in Level 6. Vegapunk later cloned Doflamingo as one of the Seraphim to replace the Warlords. Doflamingo is first introduced during the Skypiea Saga, having a minor role during its epilogue as Bellamy's superior. He is also a major antagonist in the Marineford Arc where he took part in the Summit War of Marineford and sided with the Marines, along with most of the other Warlords of the Sea, and the main antagonist of the Dressrosa Arc and the Dressrosa Saga as a whole, being the impetus for the entirety of the saga's events.",

Eventually, he started working for Oden's usurper, shogun Kurozumi Orochi, as his money changer and bodyguard; he would successfully keep his true allegiance to the Kouzuki Family a secret and bide his time until the Scabbards finally reunited to take down Orochi and Kaidou. Apart from his Kyoshiro identity, Denjiro would disguise himself at night to rob the wealthy Flower Capital citizens and give to the poor residents of Ebisu Town, earning him the moniker \"Ushimitsu Kozo\".

Born as Kaidou's daughter and groomed from a young age to be his heir, Yamato instead developed a profound admiration for the legendary samurai Kouzuki Oden. After Oden's death, Yamato decided to become like him, impersonating him and adopting his mannerisms.

A well-known explorer, Tiger became a slave for the World Nobles at some point in his adventures. After managing to escape his captors and return to Fish-Man Island, Tiger assaulted Mary Geoise in order to free his fellow slaves. This act granted Tiger infamy among humans and admiration from his fellow Fish-Men, particularly his long-time friends Jinbe and Arlong. Tiger died from blood loss after being ambushed and shot by a squad of Marines at Foolshout Island, following his delivery of a young former slave back to her home town. He is one of the two posthumous overarching protagonists of the Fish-Man Island Arc (alongside Otohime).",

He was revered for his mastery of swordsmanship that earned him the title Sword God, as well as his feat of slaying a dragon. He is the direct ancestor of Shimotsuki Ushimaru and Roronoa Zoro. 23 years before the current storyline, Ryuma's consecrated grave in Ringo was ransacked and both his corpse and sword, Shusui were stolen by Gecko Moria. Eventually, his corpse was reanimated by Brook's shadow and turned into a zombie to serve Moria on Thriller Bark, until it was destroyed by Zoro himself in a sword duel while his sword was eventually returned to his grave. He is the same Ryuma from Oda's one-shot Monsters and its anime adaptation, Monsters: 103 Mercies Dragon Damnation.",

Luffy. Formerly a bounty hunter, he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc. Born in the East Blue and raised in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is a descendant of the Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and the legendary samurai Ryuma; his grandmother Shimotsuki Furiko, the sister of former daimyo Ushimaru, emigrated from Wano to the East Blue. As a master of Three Sword Style, Zoro is one of the three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji, who are referred to as the \"Monster Trio\". His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend and distant cousin, Kuina. In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former bounty hunter, his sizeable bounty upon arriving at the Sabaody Archipelago caused Zoro, along with Luffy, to be included among the eleven \"Super Rookies\", pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties of over 100,000,000 shortly before the Summit War. He, the other ten Super Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach would go on to be referred to as the \"Worst Generation.\" Zoro gained his first bounty of 60,000,000 after the Arabasta Arc. It later increased to 120,000,000 after the Enies Lobby incident, then again to 320,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was augmented to 1,111,000,000.",

For this sole purpose, it conducted countless acts of espionage, sabotage, and murder over a span of years, ultimately manipulating Arabasta into civil war. While the syndicate mostly employed common bounty hunters and mercenaries (motivated by the half-truth that they were building a new, \"ideal\" nation), its elite members contained significantly skilled combatants and spies. Despite multiple setbacks, its endgame Operation Utopia nearly succeeded in every objective, and was only narrowly stopped by the combined efforts of Princess Nefertari Vivi, the Straw Hat Pirates, and a unit of Marines led by then-Captain Smoker. After Operation Utopia's failure, the syndicate was exposed and dismantled, with Crocodile and most of his subordinates—many personally defeated by the Straw Hats—arrested by the Marines. In years to come, however, many of them would escape and continue to impact world events. Due to their actions and role, they are collectively the main antagonists of the Arabasta Saga, with varying members being the focus of each individual arc (excluding the Drum Island Arc). Several ex-members also serve as the protagonists of the Miss Goldenweek's \"Operation: Meet Baroque Works\" cover arc, and supporting characters in the Impel Down Arc and Marineford Arc.",

Roger was the first pirate in history since Joy Boy to circumnavigate the Grand Line, culminating in reaching its final island which he named Laugh Tale. However, knowing that his life was limited by an incurable disease, Roger disbanded his crew and turned himself in to be executed. Though the World Government staged the execution as a public spectacle to discourage piracy, Roger used his final words to ensure the opposite, openly declaring that the One Piece belonged to anyone that could find it. As such, he singlehandedly began the Great Pirate Era. Because of his past actions and achievements, Roger is a central background character in the series as a whole.",

In his youth, Moria served as captain of the Gecko Pirates, until a vast majority of its members were killed in a fight against Kaidou of the Four Emperors. This traumatic event led Moria to seek power through an army of zombies, constructed by his subordinate, Dr. Hogback. To that end he stole the shadows of several beings with his Kage Kage no Mi powers, including Brook and several members of the Straw Hat Pirates, bringing him into conflict with them. His zombie army was ultimately destroyed and the captured shadows set free after his defeat, but he retained his position as a Warlord and escaped Thriller Bark with the remnants of his crew. He took part in the Summit War of Marineford and sided with the Marines along with most of the other Warlords. After the end of the war, he was stripped of his title and was to be eliminated by Donquixote Doflamingo, but he managed to escape into the New World. Vegapunk later cloned Moria as one of the Seraphim to replace the Warlords. Two years after the war, he attacked the Blackbeard Pirates on Hachinosu, but was defeated and imprisoned when he refused to join Blackbeard. He was later rescued by Perona with the help of Koby. He is the main antagonist of the Thriller Bark Saga and a major antagonist in the Marineford Arc.",

      "short_bio": "Kaidou of the Beasts, renowned as the world's \"Strongest Creature\", is the Governor-General of the Beasts Pirates and was formerly one of the Four Emperors who ruled over the New World. He is also the father of Yamato. Once a child soldier in the service of the Vodka Kingdom, Kaidou joined the legendary Rocks Pirates as an apprentice in his teenage years. A few years after the God Valley Incident, he formed his own pirate crew and built it up into a powerful military force determined to challenge the World Government and change the world. Kaidou then joined forces with Wano Country's shogun Kurozumi Orochi and occupied Onigashima as his base for nearly three decades. In the present day, Kaidou formed an unprecedented pirate alliance with fellow Emperor and former crewmate Big Mom for the purpose of taking over the world. He then betrayed Orochi to enact his New Onigashima Project for Wano. The plan never came to fruition, however, as Onigashima was raided by the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance on that very same night and Kaidou was ultimately bested by Monkey D. Luffy. Following this defeat, Kaidou lost his position among the Four Emperors. Kaidou was first referred to by Monkey D. Garp in the Post-Enies Lobby Arc when he revealed the existence of the Four Emperors, and was then first directly mentioned by Gecko Moria in the Thriller Bark Arc. Before he debuted in person, his voice was heard in a flashback that Kouzuki Momonosuke had when first disembarking on Dressrosa. Due to his actions, he can be considered the overarching antagonist of the Dressrosa Saga, the main antagonist of the Wano Country Arc and Saga, and a major antagonist of the second half of the series."

Orochi ruled Wano tyrannically until he was deposed by none other than Kaidou, who betrayed him to seize Wano for himself; Orochi survived Kaidou's attack and tried to kill everyone on Onigashima out of spite but was then killed after two encounters with the Kouzuki Family's Nine Red Scabbards who he knew had been prophesied to overthrow him.
