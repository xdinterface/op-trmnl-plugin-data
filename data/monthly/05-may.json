A few years after the God Valley Incident, he formed his own pirate crew and built it up into a powerful military force determined to challenge the World Government and change the world. Kaidou then joined forces with Wano Country's shogun Kurozumi Orochi and occupied Onigashima as his base for nearly three decades. In the present day, Kaidou formed an unprecedented pirate alliance with fellow Emperor and former crewmate Big Mom for the purpose of taking over the world. He then betrayed Orochi to enact his New Onigashima Project for Wano. The plan never came to fruition, however, as Onigashima was raided by the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance on that very same night and Kaidou was ultimately bested by Monkey D. Luffy. Following this defeat, Kaidou lost his position among the Four Emperors. Kaidou was first referred to by Monkey D. Garp in the Post-Enies Lobby Arc when he revealed the existence of the Four Emperors, and was then first directly mentioned by Gecko Moria in the Thriller Bark Arc. Before he debuted in person, his voice was heard in a flashback that Kouzuki Momonosuke had when first disembarking on Dressrosa. Due to his actions, he can be considered the overarching antagonist of the Dressrosa Saga, the main antagonist of the Wano Country Arc and Saga, and a major antagonist of the second half of the series.",

His prestigious career has not only afforded him multiple promotion offers to Admiral, but the freedom to refuse (due to his deep hatred and contempt for World Nobles) without consequence. At the same time, he has mentored many younger Marines into prominence, including once-Admiral Kuzan and SWORD members Koby and Helmeppo. After Ace's death at the Summit War of Marineford, Garp became an instructor to focus on training new recruits. While the public believes him to be retired, he still retains the rank of Vice Admiral.

He pursues the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger in order to become the new Pirate King and reach a further, untold dream (currently known to only his crew, family and closest friends). He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world. Born on Dawn Island, Luffy is the son of Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon and grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp and as such is a member of the Clan of D. Most of his childhood was shaped by Garp and Curly Dadan, under whose care he befriended and swore brotherhood to the late Portgas D. Ace and Sabo. However, he draws his greatest inspiration from the pirate Shanks, who (unwittingly) enabled him to eat the Devil Fruit that turned his body into rubber, sacrificed an arm to save his life, and gifted his signature straw hat as a symbol of their vow to reunite someday, after Luffy became a great pirate. As a pirate, Luffy has actively opposed countless regional, national, and global powers, beginning with several established East Blue pirates and extending to the Marines, the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Cipher Pol, the World Nobles and Five Elders, and even the Four Emperors of the New World. Despite his young age and relatively short career, he has triumphed over a majority of these, successfully invading and indirectly causing the annihilation of Enies Lobby, escaping the impregnable Impel Down, enabling several key developments in the Summit War of Marineford, and defeating three Warlords and an Emperor in direct combat. At the same time, he carries a great penchant for attracting friends and allies; in addition to personally engaging every member of his crew, he has earned regard and gratitude among many nations, fellow pirates, the Revolutionary Army, and even several Marines. Luffy has gained worldwide infamy through his accomplishments, heritage, and general recklessness, drawing many large bounties as well as the focused hostility of the World Government, Marine Headquarters, and Fleet Admiral Sakazuki in particular. Currently, he is recognized as a central member of the Worst Generation, the unwilling leader of the seven-crew Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and—in wake of defeating Kaidou during the Raid on Onigashima—one of the Four Emperors, with a bounty of 3,000,000,000. Since the awakening of the Gomu Gomu no Mi for the first time in centuries, Luffy has also been heralded as the second coming of Joy Boy, as well as the current incarnation of the Sun God, Nika.

He is also the father of Yamato. Once a child soldier in the service of the Vodka Kingdom, Kaidou joined the legendary Rocks Pirates as an apprentice in his teenage years. A few years after the God Valley Incident, he formed his own pirate crew and built it up into a powerful military force determined to challenge the World Government and change the world. Kaidou then joined forces with Wano Country's shogun Kurozumi Orochi and occupied Onigashima as his base for nearly three decades. In the present day, Kaidou formed an unprecedented pirate alliance with fellow Emperor and former crewmate Big Mom for the purpose of taking over the world. He then betrayed Orochi to enact his New Onigashima Project for Wano. The plan never came to fruition, however, as Onigashima was raided by the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance on that very same night and Kaidou was ultimately bested by Monkey D. Luffy. Following this defeat, Kaidou lost his position among the Four Emperors. Kaidou was first referred to by Monkey D. Garp in the Post-Enies Lobby Arc when he revealed the existence of the Four Emperors, and was then first directly mentioned by Gecko Moria in the Thriller Bark Arc. Before he debuted in person, his voice was heard in a flashback that Kouzuki Momonosuke had when first disembarking on Dressrosa. Due to his actions, he can be considered the overarching antagonist of the Dressrosa Saga, the main antagonist of the Wano Country Arc and Saga, and a major antagonist of the second half of the series.",
