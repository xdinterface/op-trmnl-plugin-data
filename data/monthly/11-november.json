Luffy. Formerly a bounty hunter, he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc. Born in the East Blue and raised in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is a descendant of the Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and the legendary samurai Ryuma; his grandmother Shimotsuki Furiko, the sister of former daimyo Ushimaru, emigrated from Wano to the East Blue. As a master of Three Sword Style, Zoro is one of the three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji, who are referred to as the \"Monster Trio\". His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend and distant cousin, Kuina. In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former bounty hunter, his sizeable bounty upon arriving at the Sabaody Archipelago caused Zoro, along with Luffy, to be included among the eleven \"Super Rookies\", pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties of over 100,000,000 shortly before the Summit War. He, the other ten Super Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach would go on to be referred to as the \"Worst Generation.\" Zoro gained his first bounty of 60,000,000 after the Arabasta Arc. It later increased to 120,000,000 after the Enies Lobby incident, then again to 320,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was augmented to 1,111,000,000.",
