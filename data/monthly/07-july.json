After his family lost their status as Celestial Dragons and became pariahs, Rosinante was discovered by Sengoku and enlisted into the Marines, eventually reaching the rank of Commander. Upon reuniting with Doflamingo, he feigned muteness and operated as an Elite Officer of the Donquixote Pirates, serving Doflamingo under the codename Corazon while remaining an undercover Marine. Rosinante abandoned his post in an attempt to cure Trafalgar D. Water Law of his Amber Lead Syndrome. He eventually obtained the Ope Ope no Mi, forcing Law to eat it and thus giving him the means to save himself from the disease. However, his cover was blown by the former Corazon, Vergo, and he was subsequently executed by Doflamingo. Rosinante's kindness and sacrifice would serve as driving motivators for Law to one day avenge him by defeating Doflamingo.",

After losing his parents, he was instructed by Kurozumi Orochi to operate undercover within the Kouzuki Family. Kanjuro became Kouzuki Oden's retainer and one of the Nine Red Scabbards while secretly aiding Orochi in his rise to power and efforts to eliminate the Kouzuki bloodline, by feeding him information. He would continue to do so until he revealed himself as Orochi's spy just before the Raid on Onigashima, leading to his former comrades engaging in battle with him until he was lethally wounded by Kin'emon during a final skirmish, dubbing it his final act. He was born 54 years before the present day, but traveled 20 years forward in time when he was 34 years old. He acted as an ally to the Straw Hat Pirates in his undercover role during the Dressrosa Arc and Zou Arc, but was revealed to be a major antagonist of the Wano Country Arc during its third act.",
